## CIS3330-CASA-6

In this Class Assignment (CASA), you need to execute the code given as examples in the assigned book chapters.

*  Chapter 6.1 "A string is a sequence" from Severance (2019)
*  Chapter 6.2 "Getting the length of a string using len" from Severance (2019)
*  Chapter 6.3 "Traverse through a string with a loop" from Severance (2019)
*  Chapter 6.4 "String Slices" from Severance (2019)


**Important Note:** This code repository will not run automated testing. Therefore, there is no need to check if your code will pass the automated testing.

## Instructions

In the file casa_arithmetic_and_string_operations.py, code the examples given in the assigned book chapter. To receive full credit, make the following modifications to the code:

*  Change the value of the variable **fruit** and **s** in all the programming statements that apply.
*  Comment the lines of code (using the **#** character) that will trigger Type and Index errors.

Your code should include all the example codes in the book and run without errors to receive full credit. Again, this code will not be run against the automated testing. Therefore **there is no need** for you to check if your program passed the automated testing.
